# OsuSkinScrambler

## How do I use this?

First, edit path.txt. Make sure that the path points to the "Skins" folder in your osu directory. This can be done for most people by replacing "USERNAME" with your username and changing the drive letter if necessary.

Next, run \_\_main\_\_.py. Type in the name of the skin. This can also be supplied as a command line argument. ex: `python3 __main__.py "My funny skin"`

Finally, open osu and go to Options. There should be 2 copies (or more, depending on how many times you've run it) of the skin you selected: The original, and one with a timestamp. select the one with a timestamp, and you should be good to go.
